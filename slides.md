### My work at Nordic Semiconductor

#### 2017

First full time cloud engineer working on [nrfcloud.com](https://nrfcloud.com/)
building Software-as-a-service (Saas) offering.

#### 2019

Application Group to work on on open-source end-to-end examples of real world
IoT products.

## Agenda

- Why _serverless_?
- Scenario overview
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) implementation
- Microsoft Azure

## What is _serverless_?

_Serverless computing allows me to focus on implementing the solution, and not
spend time on maintaining the infrastructure needed to execute it._

More detailed analysis:
[martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)

## Why I like serverless

- build globally scalable solutions with a small team
- suprises are rare, allows me to go on vacation

:::notes

Going serverless allows me and a rather small team of engineers to build a
globally scalable software solution with a very high confidence in it's
scalability and an ease of mind during operations.

In the last years since I have been working fully serverless, I have not once
experienced a surprising event that impacted our production system.

Yes, we experience issues which gradually become more serious over time, but in
general it happens in a way that does not interfere with my vacation plans.

Serverless not only enables horizontal scalability, but allows to update each
component of the solution individually: the code for a lambda function can be
replaced without affecting other functions. This means no more waiting minutes
for a monolithic container to come up again after a fix has been deployed.

:::

## Horizontal Scalablity

- Serverless implementations depend on _stateless_, _event-driven_
  implementations.
- This allows to process as many requests as needed, in _parallel_.
- However, you have to deal with eventual consistency.

## Updating individual components

Instead of restarting the instance,  
I can update _an individual function_.

:::notes

Serverless not only enables horizontal scalability, but allows to update each
component of the solution individually: the code for a lambda function can be
replaced without affecting other functions. This means no more waiting minutes
for a monolithic container to come up again after a fix has been deployed.

:::

## Downsides of serverless

- Testing cloud-native solutions really is a challenge.
- More ceremony involved, defining infrastructure as code is now your job.
- Impossible to run it locally.
- Huge mindset shift from the classical application server model (LAMP, Tomcat,
  Rails), to a serverless, stateless, eventual consistent application
  development model.

## IoT <3 Serverless

- Many, many devices, that don't share global state
- Needs to scale to billions of devices, connections, message per day
- Many different operations with different business needs (processing) on small
  datasets, suits serverless microservice model very well

## Architecture Example: store and retrieve temperature data
